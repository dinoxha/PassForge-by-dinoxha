# PassForge-by-dinoxha
I've created my own password encryption tool — simple, fast, and effective! 🛡💻
It currently supports the following encryption methods:

🔐 ROT13

🔐 SHA256

🔐 SHA512

🔐 Base64

This lightweight tool helps you encrypt your passwords without any hassle.
🧩 Works fast, runs smoothly, and keeps your data safe!

🚧 Current Limitations
⚠️ Passwords are not saved for now — intentionally, for maximum security.
However, in future versions, I plan to add an encrypted JSON password storage system!

💡 Why open-source?
Because transparency matters! 💥
Feel free to explore the code, learn from it, or even contribute and improve it.

Stay tuned — exciting updates are coming! 🚀
